workflow of webscraping:
The web scraper extracts  information such as Heading, subheadings, and codeblocks  from Python Packaging Docs.
It uses BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and requests for making HTTP requests.
The script follows these steps:
1. Fetches the HTML content of the Python Packaging Docs page.
2. Parses the HTML content to extract relevant information using BeautifulSoup.
3. Writes the extracted data to a CSV file.

## Input and Output
- Input: The script requires the URL of the Python Packaging Docs as input.
- Output: The scraped data is saved to a CSV file specified by the user.

## Error Handling
- If the URL provided is invalid or the page structure changes, the script will raise an error and exit gracefully.
- Detailed error messages are provided to assist with troubleshooting.
